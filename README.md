> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT: This application requires a local server to run!**
> 
> Dave cannot be opened directly as a file in your browser due to security restrictions with JavaScript modules.
> You must start the server first using one of the methods below.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start the application
npm start

# Or use the startup scripts
./scripts/Dave.sh    # Linux/macOS
scripts\Dave.bat     # Windows
```

Then open http://localhost:7777/ in your browser.

**Note:** If you accidentally open `index.html` or `src/index.html` directly in your browser, you'll see instructions on how to properly start the server.
